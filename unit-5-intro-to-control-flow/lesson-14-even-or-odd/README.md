# Return whether an input number is even or odd

Write a function that will take in a number, and return whether it's even or odd. 

Hint: You'll need to use the % (modulus) operator to get the remainder when dividing by 2 to determine if the number is even or odd.

```python
even_or_odd(57) == 'odd'
even_or_odd(2422) == 'even'
```
