# String of Numbers

Write a function called `string_of_numbers` that receives an integer `length`
and uses a while loop to create and return a string of consecutive numbers from 1 up to the number `length`.

Examples:

```python
>>>  string_of_numbers(3)
'123'

>>>  string_of_numbers(5)
'12345'
```

Hint:
_You'll need variables to store your result string and a number keeping track of what loop your on.
You might need to use the str() function to change an integer into a string at some point._
