# Double Down

Complete the function `double_down` so that it receives a number `num` and
an integer `times_doubled` and returns `num` doubled `times_doubled` amount of times.
Use a while loop to do this (and for everyone's sake, no infinite loops!).

Examples:

```python
>>>  double_down(3, 3)
24

>>>  double_down(2, 0)
2

>>>  double_down(4, 1)
8
```
